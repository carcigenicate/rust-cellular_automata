# Cellular Automata

The eventual goal of this repo is to create a generalized "cellular automata engine" that allows for simulating different
cellular automata by swapping out some blocks that house the rules of the automata.

For now, though, it just has a basic implementation of Wireworld which will likely be expanded to include
a full UI. Currently, running `main` just yields a loop of wire with a propagating electron.
